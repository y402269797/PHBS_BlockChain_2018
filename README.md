## 1. Introduction to the more centralized bitcoin value chain
Introduced under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin adopts a decentralized network architecture based on cryptography. With consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system, independent Bitcoin miners use their mining hardware to maintain and profit from the Bitcoin network. Users of the Bitcoin network receive and send Bitcoins through the peer-to-peer network without support from banks or other third parties.  

Given the expansion of the Bitcoin network and the rise in bitcoin prices, the Bitcoin network has encountered problems such as declining reward for miners and slower transaction processing speed. Along the way, Bitcoin mining chips, pools and farms, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges have entered the industry, and we believe the Bitcoin value chain is becoming centralized.
